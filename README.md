## Aragon Path Finder ðŸ›¤
Multiple Transaction Path Visualization & Transaction Sending tool for Aragon 
<br> 

## Project Description
Currently, the Aragon connect API uses the BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path automatically and forwards the transactions along that path. But for more sophisticated users the different paths like longest, shortest, etc might matter. This tool displays all the possible paths for a particular transaction. So the user can view all the possible paths and easily determine which path is longest, shortest, etc as per the requirement. This tool will also be useful for users to make sure that their transaction is indeed forwarded via the shortest path.

The application supports choosing one path from multiple available paths. Also, one can send the transaction through the chosen path using metamask.
